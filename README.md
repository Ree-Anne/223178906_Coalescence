### PLEASE READ:
For testers - please email 223178906rong@deakin.edu.au first. I messed something up and setting up the testing server and proxy on server.js will break unless I add an exception and load the demo fileset.  

I will run you through the setup + testing instructions over Teams for the demo files, then you can try create your own board (will likely crash). Ctrl+W the tab and restart server if the board starts to duplicate images/text repeatedly, then load demo.xml again.  

DISABLE ALL UNNECESSARY EXTENSIONS BEFORE TESTING.  
Should otherwise work with Chrome, Chromium and Firefox browsers, as well as all standard mobile browsers (very poorly but should still appear to visually load)
