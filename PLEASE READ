PLEASE READ:
For people testing - please email 223178906rong@deakin.edu.au first. I messed something up and setting up the testing server and proxy on server.js will break unless I add an exception and load the demo fileset.
I will run you through the setup + testing instructions over Teams for the demo files, then you can try create your own board (will likely crash)
